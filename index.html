                My name is Haleigh Smoot, I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. In 2016 I graduated from Texas Tech University, and moved to San Diego, California to begin my career. After living in San Diego and working full time for two years, I decided it was time to go back to school and further my education. After extensive research on Full Stack Web Development programs, I made the decision to go to Universty of California San Diego to further my career in Web Development. I began dabbling in Web Development as early as the myspace days, but mainly just html. After myspace had eventually died and facebook took over, I stayed stagnent in html, and learned no other skills. About ten years passed, and I finally picked it back up again, I began making basic wordpress sites, but only as a hobby. (You can see some of my work here <a href="haleighsmoot.com">haleighsmoot.com</a>, <a href="thebrokenyolkcafe.com">thebrokenyolkcafe.com</a>, <a href="themoonandvenus.com">themoonandvenus.com</a>, <a href="digitaldynamicslab.com">digitialdynamicslab.com</a>) Wordpress was and still is great content managemnt system, but eventually I wanted to learn to do more. So here with this very website I began my journey to do just that, learn more.
